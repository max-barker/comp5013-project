## How to start the artifact.

Simply load the Jupyter notebook file into an interpreter and run each cell - if Jupyter is not installed on your local machine, it can be opened in Google Collab and run there.

If running locally, you need to ensure all libraries are install. This can be done with the Python Package managers pip or conda.
